It starts off with an example that completely caught me off-guard.  The first video discussed an example that left me wondering why is the instructor even discussing all of that, at this point.  What’s the context and the motivation?  Moreover, every slide is filled to the brim with text.  Can’t decide whether to read it or listen to the speaker.  Neither does give me much understanding anyway.  It was filled with terminology that I’m yet to pick up.  The speaker didn’t apparently know much about who the audience is, and what are they aware of, and what they aren’t…In short, it failed to implement any of the very matter it speaks of - Understanding the problem.\nSummary.  I feel the course is offered too early.  Rather, I took it a little too early.\nDefinitely, I can’t relate to most things the speaker is talking about.  At least, I don’t see how and where the ideas will gel with our program.  I’m sure it does, but now, I don’t know how.\nSorry, I’d never been as critical about anything as this one.  I just had to.

Granted, it was mentioned in the orientation that it would only be tools with no explanation.\nBut I am hopeful that this will get better in the later weeks as this is the only “comprehension” type of week (reminiscent of the english courses lol).

Should I use Docker for this course?\nther response was different.\n{\n\"answer\"\n:\n\"Hello! \\n\\nFor this course, you can use either Docker or Podman, as both are capable containerization tools. However, based on the context provided, it seems that Docker Desktop might not be the preferred choice, especially for organizations or environments where licensing costs are a concern.\\n\\nIf you're already familiar with Docker, you can continue using it. If you're interested in exploring an alternative, Podman is a good option—it is compatible with many Docker commands and offers similar functionality without requiring a daemon or root privileges.\\n\\nIn summary:\\n- If you're comfortable with Docker, you can proceed with it.\\n- If you'd like to try Podman, it's a suitable alternative and worth exploring.\\n\\nLet me know if you need guidance on setting up or using Podman!\"\n,\n\"links\"\n:\n[\n{\n\"url\"\n:\n\"https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/161120/19\"\n,\n\"text\"\n:\n\"@Nelson I would recommend Podman or Docker CE rather than Docker Desktop.\\nDocker Desktop is not free for organizations over 250 people and many organizations have therefore moved away from it.\"\n}\n,\n{\n\"url\"\n:\n\"https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/161083/17\"\n,\n\"text\"\n:\n\"Hi Suhani,\\nnpm does not require docker.\\nKind regards\"\n}\n,\n{\n\"url\"\n:\n\"https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/167415/2\"\n,\n\"text\"\n:\n\"The name of the Dockerfile should be “Dockerfile” indeed, more over check other sections of your submission like\\n\\nIs the GitHub repo public?\\nDoes it have an MIT license?\\nDoes it have a DockerFile?\\nIs the Docker image accessible?\\n\"\n}\n]\n}\nI have tried clearing the local cache using bleachbit I would clear all cache but nothing worked.

After watching the live sessions, I realized that my approach was wrong. The live sessions are really good\nbut\n, they are being conducted too close to the deadline (started on 10th June). In the sessions, it was said that this project could be completed in a day, but I don’t feel that this is the case for me (not even close), though that might just be my own inefficiency.\nAside from that, the method of using the Gemini model demonstrated in the sessions only allowed me to generate embeddings for the first 100 chunks (max per day), there are way more than that in my workflow. I have to spend time finding other alternatives to create embeddings before I make the final submission with the openAI api. So, I humbly request, if it is possible, please consider extending the deadline by a few days. There is not enough time to absorb what was taught in the live sessions and implement it as complete beginner.\nThank you."

I was not given an updated enrollment list of students on the course, so although we have your submission scores it was not pushed to the dashboard because as far as I was aware you were not on TDS enrollment list that was provided to us by operations\n@jkmadathil\n. We will make the corrections and inform operations. It will take a few days to get sorted out.\nThanks for letting us know and for your patience.\nKind regards\nTDS Team"

It may be recoverable, but for future make sure you have regular backups of your work in the cloud like on OneDrive or Google Drive. Then recovery from fatal erasures is trivial.\nAs far as how to recover the files totally depends on what happened and if you have any recovery systems in place. It is hard to give generic advice without knowing your system. If there is Roll back or File History in your system it is quite possible to recover the files. Or if your work is all within OneDrive for example.\nKind regards"
